# transitive

This project was generated by [cmake-init][1].  
It's heavily stripped down to focus on showing how to propagate transitive
dependencies.

# Other examples

This example is similar to [cmake-init-multi-target][2], because this library
can be built as a static library, in which case private dependencies will show
up in your public link dependencies as `$<LINK_ONLY:...>` generator expressions
and similar to [cmake-init-use-pkg-config][3], because you have to modify the
installed config file to propagate dependencies.

# Steps to take

* [Link to the dependencies](CMakeLists.txt#L62) according to your requirements
  (`PRIVATE` is *build* requirement, `INTERFACE` is *usage* requirement,
  `PUBLIC` is both)
* Make the [install config](cmake/install-config.cmake.in) configurable based
  on [`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`][4] and propagate dependencies according to their
  requirement using [`find_dependency`][5]

Making your config file configurable based on `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` is necessary
only if you have dependencies that are only build requirements.
